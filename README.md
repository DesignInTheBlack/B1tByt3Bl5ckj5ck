# B1tByt3 Bl5ckj5ck

B1tByt3 Bl5ckj5ck is a web-based implementation of the classic game Blackjack for the purposes of demonstrating technical competency in React.JS, Next.JS, Tailwind, etc

## Project Prompt

The project was developed based on the following prompt:

- The game consists of two players: the player vs the House (the computer).
- The goal is to beat the House's hand without going over 21 points.
- The House is initially dealt two face-up cards and no more.
- The player is initially dealt two face-up cards and has the options to "Hit" (draw more cards) or "Stand" (end their turn).
- The game ends when the player's card value exceeds 21 (automatic loss) or when the player chooses to "Stand".
- The application displays whether the player won or lost at the end of the game.

## Technologies Used

The B1tByt3 Bl5ckj5ck application is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering, routing, and more.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Framer Motion: A library for creating smooth animations in React.
- Deck of Cards API: An external API (deckofcardsapi.com) used for managing the deck of cards.

## Hypothetical Next Steps

If this were an actual in-development application, my next steps might include:

1. Code intended for production should be testable and a framework of unit tests developed accordingly. (Potentially Cypress?)
2. Error handling would need to be significantly more robust to avoid edge cases and allow for soft landings in the event of an unexpected error.
3. Application is currently MVP and as such is not appropriately mobile responsive.
4. API could be broken out into routes via Next to leverage the frameworks features more extensively.
